            <p>
                <img src="./images/selfie.jpg">
                I am passionate leader that is ready to take the tech world on. I have been in trade school management
                for 16 years and have
                a passion of leading and inspiring people. I love the tech industry and the agile environment it has
                around it. I entered the industry through a Full-Stack Java Bootcamp. I am a student of life,
                personal growth addict, team-player, always trying to think-outside of the box and then expand the box,
                and always trying to build everyone around me.
